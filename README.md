# XAI_evaluation_HNC
This is the official implementation code of paper "Ranking XAI Methods for Head and Neck Cancer Outcome Prediction", which is sumitted to ISBI 2026. 
This study implemented a comprehensive evaluation of 13 explainable (saliency-based) AI methods using 20 metrics of faithfulness, robustness, complexity and plausibility. The user case is a head and neck outcome prediction model based on 3D DenseNet121 with the input of CT/PET/GTV. 

The framework is as below:
